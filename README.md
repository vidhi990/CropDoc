# 🌱 Crop Doctor: Disease Detection and Optimal Plant Location Predictor 🌱

Crop Doctor is a powerful web application built using image processing, OpenCV, regression models, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques. It serves as the ultimate Crop Doctor, offering two essential functionalities: disease detection in 15 varieties of plants (Pepper, Potato, Tomato) and predicting the optimal location for these plants.

# 🔍 Features:

Disease Detection: Crop Doctor utilizes image processing and machine learning algorithms to detect diseases in 15 different varieties of plants. By analyzing images of plant leaves, it accurately identifies and classifies diseases, helping farmers take timely actions to mitigate crop damage.
Optimal Plant Location Predictor: In addition to disease detection, Crop Doctor provides the ability to predict the best suitable soil for growing plants. By leveraging regression models and ANN techniques, it suggests optimal locations for specific plants, considering soil characteristics and environmental factors.
# 💻 Technical Stack:
Crop Doctor is built using Python and employs various libraries and frameworks, including TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Flask, OpenCV, and Keras. These technologies enable efficient image processing, model implementation, and web application development.

# 🌿 Benefits:

Empowers farmers and agricultural enthusiasts with an easy-to-use tool for disease detection in plants.
Facilitates timely intervention to prevent crop losses caused by diseases.
Helps farmers make informed decisions about suitable locations for different plants based on soil characteristics and environmental factors.
Enhances crop yield and farming efficiency by providing targeted recommendations for disease control and optimal planting locations.

# 🚀 Usage:
To experience the power of Crop Doctor, simply run the command python app.py in your command prompt or terminal. This will start the Flask application, and you can access it by opening your browser and typing in the provided URL.
